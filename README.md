Wins 1v1 wordle

Made a bot to beat my friends in wordle 1v1. Game is played here: https://wordle.jonyork.net/

Was too lazy to make simple image recognition for where the boxes are because I just wanted to beat my friends quick.
So the script only works if your monitor has the same dimensions as mine and the tab is full screened.
Easily changeable though.
